# DyfoLabs-Assignment

## Brief:
  `A responsive web app which accepts multiple sets of location points (in the form of coordinates/area names, or marker) and then
   plots them on a Google Map/Bing Map. Next, find the shortest path which connects all the points and display that on the same map. Also
   build a screen that displays the logs of all the previously computed routes.`

## Resources:
  `Google Maps API + Django for backend`
